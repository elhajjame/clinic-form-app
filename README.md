# 🏥 Appointment Management System (Vanilla JS)

A simple web-based appointment registration system that allows users to submit appointment details and manage them dynamically using **JavaScript** and **localStorage**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built to practice **DOM manipulation**, **form validation**, and **localStorage** in JavaScript.  
Users can register appointments, view them in a table, and delete them without using any backend.
